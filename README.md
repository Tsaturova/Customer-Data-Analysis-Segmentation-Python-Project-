 Customer Data Analysis & Segmentation (Python Project)

# Project Objective
The aim of this project was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a customer dataset and identify behavioral patterns and segmentation opportunities. The work was completed as part of the Data Analyst Expert program at John Bryce College.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains customer-level attributes such as:
- Demographics: age, gender, location
- Financial: income level, spending scores
- Behavioral: purchasing tendencies and segments

## Project Steps
1. **Data Import & Cleaning**:  
   - Handled missing values and inconsistent data
   - Reformatted key variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualized age, gender, income, spending distributions  
   - Identified outliers and distribution trends

3. **Segmentation Patterns**:  
   - Analyzed correlation between income and spending  
   - Identified clusters in customer behavior using visual cues

4. **Visualization**:  
   - Created boxplots, scatter plots, bar charts  
   - Showed group patterns by gender and income brackets

## Key Insights
- Spending behavior differs significantly across age and income groups  
- Certain customer types (e.g. young high-income) show distinct spending patterns  
- Found potential segmentation logic for targeted marketing

##  Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- CSV Dataset

## Academic Result
**Grade: 85/100**
